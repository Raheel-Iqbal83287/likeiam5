# **App Name**: Explain It Simply

## Core Features:

- Simple UI: Provide a clear and simple user interface for easy interaction.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0D2EB) to evoke trust and clarity.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F4F8) for a clean and modern feel.
- Accent color: Gentle green (#90EE90) for highlights and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that combines a modern, machined look and suitability for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, intuitive icons for primary actions. Icons should be designed with rounded edges to maintain the friendly feel.
- A clean, single-column layout is ideal for clarity, with ample white space to focus attention on the text.
- Subtle animations, like a fade-in effect for the simplified text, to add a touch of delight and smoothness to the user experience.
